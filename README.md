# Bypass Linkis
This is a userscript to bypass annoying ln.is landing pages.

It ultimately aims at preventing users from authorize Linkis.com via Twitter OAuth.
This script skips landing page so users will not see authorize buttons.

**IMPORTANT: This script is for self-defense purpose only. 
Users must keep a close watch for applications you have authorized on twitter. 
At least other users are annoyed at your tweet, when Linkis.com has permission to access your account.**

# Notice about environment
This script is currently *only* tested with Greasemonkey on Firefox.

# License
You can use this program under the condition of [ISC License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license).
